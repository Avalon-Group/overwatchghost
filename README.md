# Overwatch Ghost - Source Code

**Today is a good day, as we present to you the source code of a newly founded Overwatch """spoofer""".**

To be exact this so-called spoofer is simply a paste of [Anti-Flag](https://github.com/dword64/Ow-Anti-Flag) from [AVISIX](https://github.com/AVISIX) and [dword64](https://github.com/dword64) with a little more features like DMIEdit, VolumeId64, etc.

The developers were **too incompetent** to somewhat secure their spoofer, as it doesn't have any security whatsoever.

It is made in Electron and all the source code is open, including all the scripts and tools they use. (*You can just extract everything using 7Zip*)

They are selling you **garbage** for **20 euros a month** that is widely available **for free** on the internet.

We do **NOT** support behavior like this, hence why we are releasing the extracted source code + some funny conversations to prove our point. 

### March 2023 Update

After releasing the initial release of this leak/crack, we were contacted by the admin of Ghost (*Takenotez âœŽâœŽâœŽ...#8417*)

We had some discussions and were hoping they would do their homework, because the current Anti-Flag version is out-dated. 

Sadly we were terribly disappointed and it ended up being a gigantic timewaste.

You can read some of the stuff the Founder wrote [here](https://github.com/Avalon-Group/Ghost-Overwatch-Source/tree/main/screenshots).

## How do we know its pasted?

We have confirmed that the registry keys, commands and more are the exact same as the ones used in the public version of Anti-Flag.

### PC-Rename

The PC-Renaming feature of Anti-Flag uses a Powershell script to rename your windows device, this is completely unique to Anti-Flag and the we spent a lot of time figuring out a reliable way of renaming your PC.
